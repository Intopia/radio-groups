# Accessible radio groups

Demo version: https://intopia.github.io/radio-groups/

When presenting a set of radio button options (a radio group) to users, it is important that this group have some sort of overall label to provide context for the choices that the users are being asked to make. This is especially important for screen reader users who may arrive at a radio group with very little context.

These overall radio group labels should be programmatically associated with the radio buttons inside the radio group.

This repo tests 4 different cases.
